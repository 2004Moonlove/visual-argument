# Where did the time go?  
For my visual rhetoric project， I want to focus the fast passage of time calling everyone to cherish it. In our daily life, we may often think of the question that "Where did the time go?". It seems that the time has always been passing so fast and so quiet that the thought "What!? I have already grown up!" strikes to my mind. Inadvertently, as time passed, each of us grew up quietly.  
To show this, I want to use the scenery of the four season of a year to be the main part of my project symbolizing the pass of the time as well as a life of a person, adding the element of clock, sandglass, and old things old sceneries such as the playground of my middle school time. I will use "Where did the time go?" to be the title of my project with the biggest word size, and there will be lines of thought relative to time in the project.
